## Introduction
This project focuses on the development of an **AGV (Automatic Guided Vehicle)** prototype for material transportation in industrial settings. The AGV is a robotic system designed to operate autonomously, transporting materials across predefined routes using sensors for navigation and obstacle avoidance.

## Objectives
1. Understand the use of AGVs in industrial environments.
2. Learn the basic concepts of sensors and navigation systems in AGVs.
3. Follow the design and prototyping stages for AGV development.

## Theory
AGVs are essential in modern industry, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs. They automate the transportation of materials, components, and finished goods in factories and warehouses. Equipped with navigation sensors like **optical, laser (LIDAR), ultrasonic, and GPS**, AGVs operate autonomously in dynamic environments.

Key sensors used in AGVs:
- **Optical sensors**: Follow visual lines or paths.
- **Laser sensors (LIDAR)**: Map surroundings and avoid obstacles.
- **Ultrasonic sensors**: Detect objects nearby to prevent collisions.
- **GPS**: Navigate in wider areas.

## AGV Applications in Industry
1. **Material Transportation**: AGVs move materials between storage and production lines.
2. **Warehouse Management**: They aid in automatic storage and retrieval in warehouses.
3. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Distribution**: Deliver components to production lines precisely when needed.
4. **Kitting & Sequencing**: AGVs gather and deliver parts to assembly lines.
5. **Waste Processing**: Transport waste materials from production lines to disposal.
6. **Inspection & Testing**: Some AGVs perform automatic product quality checks.

## Project Tasks
This project involves the creation of an AGV prototype that transports components between buildings. The system includes a miniaturized simulation environment mimicking real-world industrial operations.
